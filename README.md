# RemixArt

Regardless of whether it's a book cover, album art or only template for a simple project, we are continually searching for designs over the web. Indeed, even with some prefix in our mind,
we generally don't discover what we need. Our project aims at developing a model that takes inputs in the form of text, images and even audio and attempts to produce a picture or work of
art, maybe, as photorealistic as could be expected under the circumstances. To illustrate, we work with a dataset of songs, album covers, artist images, and song lyrics to generate a
close-to-real artwork. The idea can then be put to use in various domains also, where a lot of information in various formats are available. We use GANs with alterations made to
incorporate inputs from three unique channels, and with that, we train it to learn embedding based on every one of the three distinct channels.
